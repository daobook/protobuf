"This directory contains example code that uses Protocol Buffers to manage"
" an address book. Two programs are provided for each supported language. "
"The add_person example adds a new person to an address book, prompting "
"the user to input the person's information. The list_people example lists"
" people already in the address book. The examples use the exact same "
"format in all three languages, so you can, for example, use "
"add_person_java to create an address book and then use list_people_python"
" to read it."
